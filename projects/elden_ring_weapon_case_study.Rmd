## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r weapon_data_summary}
summary(weapon_data)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r weapon_data_plot1, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = weapon_data, mapping = aes(x = attack, y = defence)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
